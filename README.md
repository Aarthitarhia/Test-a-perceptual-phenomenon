# Test-a-perceptual-phenomenon

In this project, a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect will be investigated. This enables to learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. Then some data collected from others who have performed the same task will be looked at and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, results are interpreted in terms of the hypothesis.
